**Welcome to the World of Blackjack**

Blackjack is a classic card game in which the objective is to achieve a
hand total closer to 21 than the dealer‚Äôs without exceeding it. Each
player begins with two cards and may choose to ‚Äúhit‚Äù to draw additional
cards or ‚Äústand‚Äù to keep their current hand. Number cards retain their
face value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces count as either 1 or 11.
If a hand exceeds 21, it results in a bust and the player loses. The
dealer must draw until reaching at least 17. A starting hand with an Ace
and a 10-value card is called a blackjack and typically earns a bonus.

**`blackjack` Package Overview**

The `blackjack` package offers an interactive environment for simulating
the Blackjack card game in R. Designed with flexibility in mind, it
supports both user-controlled gameplay and automated strategies,
enabling solo or multiplayer sessions. The package captures realistic
game dynamics‚Äîsuch as dealer logic, card flow and scoring, making it
suitable for simulating strategies and analysing probabilistic outcomes.

## Installation

To install the development version of the blackjack package, run the
following commands in R:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MonashARP/game-package-bilbies")
```

If the repository is private or you prefer a local setup, you can clone
it using Git. First, run git clone to download the repository to your
computer. Then, in R, set your working directory to the cloned folder
and install the package with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install()
```

| `simulation_blackjack()` | Simulate many rounds for strategy testing |

## Example

Here are some basic examples which show you how to use the package.

#### üèéÔ∏è Quick Start

Start by creating a shuffled deck and deal a hand of cards. The example
below shows how to generate a standard 52-card deck, draw two cards, and
inspect both the hand and the remaining deck.

``` r
# Make sure to load the package! 
library(blackjack) 

# Creates a full standard deck of 52 cards
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()

# Simulate drawing cards from the top of a deck
hand_result <- deal_hand(deck, n = 2)

# `hand_result` returns result of both card dealt and remaining deck 
hand_result$hand   
hand_result$deck  
```

#### üèÅ Game On!

This is a basic example that shows how to use the package to play a full
round of Blackjack. The game prompts you for input during play, allowing
you to hit, stand, double down, split, or quit depending on your
balance. It also supports several players, each taking their turn
against the dealer using the standard Blackjack rules.

``` r
# Specify the initial bet and the number of decks to use
play_blackjack(bet = 100, n_decks = 4)

# Test strategy across multiple players 
play_blackjack_multi(num_players = 3, bet = 50)
```

For simulations and automated strategy testing, you can let the computer
make decisions using the `auto_player_turn()` function. It chooses
whether to hit or stand based on the value of the current hand.

``` r
auto_player_turn(hand = c("8‚ô¶", "4‚ô†"), deck = create_shuffled_deck())
```

#### ‚ô†Ô∏è The Cards

You can use the following functions to inspect different properties
(name, rank, symbol, value and whether it‚Äôs a face card) of your card.
These functions make it easy to inspect, sort, or filter cards when
building game logic or debugging the game.

``` r
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
card <- deck[1]

card_name(card)    
card_rank(card)  
card_symbol(card)  
card_is_face(card) 
card_value(card)    
```
