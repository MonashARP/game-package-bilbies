## Introduction

`blackjackR` is a simple R package that lets you simulate the card game of Blackjack. It simulates single and multiplayer Blackjack rounds with card dealing and scoring.

## Installation

To install from source:

```r
devtools::install_github("MonashARP/game-package-bilbies", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Functions

### 1. `deal_hand()`

Randomly draw cards (default 2) from a shuffled 52-card deck. Use a separate shuffled deck to avoid duplicates when dealing to multiple players.

```r
deal_hand()
#> "10♦" "A♠"
```

### 2. `card_value()`

Score a hand in Blackjack, with logic for Aces (worth 11 unless the total would bust, in which case they count as 1).

```r
card_value(c("A♠", "K♦"))
#> 21
```

### 3. `play_blackjack()`

Simulate a single-player game round against the dealer.

```r
play_blackjack()
#> $player_hand
#> [1] "10♣" "9♦"
#> $dealer_hand
#> [1] "8♠" "Q♥"
#> $player_score
#> [1] 19
#> $dealer_score
#> [1] 18
#> $result
#> [1] "Player wins"
```

### 4. `deal_multi_hands()`

Deal 2 cards to each player from a shared shuffled deck. Support multiple players.

```r
deal_multi_hand(deck, n_players = 3)
#> $hands
#> $hands$Player_1
#> [1] "A♣" "7♠"
#> ...
#> $deck
#> [remaining cards...]
```

### 5. `play_multi_blackjack()`

Simulate a full round with multiple players and one dealer. The dealer hits until 17 or more, and each player is compared against the dealer.

```r
play_blackjack_multi(3)
#> $dealer_hand
#> [1] "9♥" "7♣"
#> $dealer_score
#> [1] 16
#> $Player_1
#> $Player_1$hand
#> [1] "A♠" "K♦"
#> $Player_1$score
#> [1] 21
#> $Player_1$result
#> [1] "Player wins"
#> ...
```

## Conclusion

`blackjack` lets you simulate hands, rounds, and multiplayer games. It can be extended with custom rules, player choices, and betting strategies.
