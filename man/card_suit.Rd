\usage{
card_suit(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `card` object or a character vector of card suits (e.g., "Spade", "Heart").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods. Not used.}
}
\value{
\describe{
  \item{\code{card}}{A character vector containing the `suit` field of each card.}
  \item{\code{character}}{The input character vector, unchanged.}
}
}
\description{
`card_suit()` retrieves the \code{suit} field from a vctrs "card" record (class \code{"card"}).
When applied to a plain character vector, it returns the vector unchanged. This function was
specifically designed to work with vctrs "card" objects created by \code{create_shuffled_deck()}.
}
\details{
- For objects of class \code{"card"}, \code{card_suit.card(x)} extracts the \code{suit} field
  via \code{vctrs::field(x, "suit")}, returning a character vector of card suits (e.g., "Hearts").
- If \code{x} is a \code{character} vector, \code{card_suit.character(x)} returns \code{x} unchanged.
- For other types, \code{card_suit.default(x)} throws an error.

\examples{
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
card_suit(deck)

card_suit(c("Hearts", "Spades"))
