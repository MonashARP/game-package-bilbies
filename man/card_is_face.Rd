\usage{
card_is_face(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either:
\itemize{
  \item A vctrs “card” record (class \code{"card"}) as returned by \code{create_shuffled_deck()},
        or any other \code{"card"} object with an \code{is_face} field; or
  \item A \code{character} vector of card names (e.g.\ \samp{"A♠", "J♥", "10♦"}).
}
Passing a \code{"card"} record returns a logical vector indicating face cards; passing a
\code{character} vector simply returns it unchanged.}
}
\value{
Depending on the method:
\describe{
  \item{\code{card}}{A \code{logical} vector (same length as \code{x}), \code{TRUE} for each face card.}
  \item{\code{character}}{The input \code{character} vector, returned as it is.}
}
}
\description{
`card_is_face()` checks whether each card in a vctrs "card" record is a face card (Jack, Queen, or King).
When applied to a plain character vector, it returns the character vector unchanged as this function was
specificly designed for vctrs "card" records.
}
\details{
- It was specificly designed for objects of class \code{"card"} (vctrs record produced by \code{create_shuffled_deck()}),
  \code{card_is_face.card(x)} extracts the \code{is_face} field via \code{vctrs::field(x, "is_face")},
  returning a logical vector (\code{TRUE} for Jack, Queen, King; \code{FALSE} otherwise).

- If \code{x} is a \code{character} vector, \code{card_is_face.character(x)} simply returns \code{x}
  unchanged (no logical test is performed).

- For any other class, \code{card_is_face.default(x)} throws an error indicating that only
  \code{"card"} or \code{character} inputs are accepted.
