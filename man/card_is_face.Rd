\title{Determine if Cards Are Face Cards}
\usage{
card_is_face(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `card` object (created by `create_shuffled_deck()`) or a character vector of card names (e.g., `"A♠"`, `"J♥"`).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods. Not used.
If `x` is a `card`, returns a logical vector indicating which are face cards. If `x` is character, returns it unchanged.}
}
\value{
Depending on the method:
\describe{
  \item{\code{card}}{A logical vector (\code{TRUE} for each face card).}
  \item{\code{character}}{The input character vector, unchanged.}
}
}
\description{
`card_is_face()` checks whether each card in a vctrs "card" record is a face card (Jack, Queen, or King).
When applied to a plain character vector, it returns the character vector unchanged, as this function was
specifically designed for vctrs "card" records.
}
\details{
- Specifically designed for objects of class \code{"card"} (vctrs record from \code{create_shuffled_deck()}).
- \code{card_is_face.card(x)} extracts the \code{is_face} field via \code{vctrs::field(x, "is_face")}.
- \code{card_is_face.character(x)} returns \code{x} unchanged.
- \code{card_is_face.default(x)} throws an error if input is not a \code{"card"} or \code{character}.
}
\examples{
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
card_is_face(deck)

card_is_face(c("J♣", "9♦", "K♠"))  # Character input: unchanged

}
