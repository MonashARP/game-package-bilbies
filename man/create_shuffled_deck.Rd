\usage{
create_shuffled_deck(noOfDecks = 4)
}
\value{
A [vctrs][vctrs::new_rcrd] "card" record vector of length `52 * noOfDecks`. Each element is an S3 object of class "card" with these fields:
\itemize{
  \item \code{name}       - character, e.g. "2\\u2663", "A\\u2660"
  \item \code{rank}       - character, one of "Two", "Three", ..., "Ace"
  \item \code{suit_symbol}- character, one of "\\u2660", "\\u2665", "\\u2666", "\\u2663"
  \item \code{suit}       - character, one of "Spade", "Heart", "Diamond", "Club"
  \item \code{is_face}    - logical; TRUE for Jack/Queen/King, FALSE otherwise
}
After update, the creating_shuffle_deck now able to return a vctrs record with the above fields instead of just a character vector.
}
\description{
Creates a shuffled Blackjack shoe consisting of multiple standard 52-card decks combined.
Each standard deck includes cards from all four suits (\\code{"\\u2660", "\\u2665", "\\u2666", "\\u2663"}) and 13 ranks (\\code{2-10, J, Q, K, A}).
The function has been updated to include a vctrs class "card" record with fields: name, rank, suit_symbol, suit, and is_face.
`name` is the card's name, `rank` is the English word for the rank, `suit_symbol` is the Unicode symbol for the suit,
`suit` is the English word for the suit, and `is_face` indicates if the card is a face card (Jack, Queen, King).
}
\details{
Because we use vctrs::new_rcrd(...), the returned object is a vctrs record with class card. You can extract the underlying
character names with as.character(), or access fields via vctrs::field(). The print.card() method will display all card names,
and format.card() returns the card's "name" field.

\examples{
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
length(deck)                   # Should be 208 (4 decks of 52 as default setting)
deck                           # Prints the deck of cards
deck2 <- create_shuffled_deck(noOfDecks = 6)
length(deck2)                 # Should be 312 (6 * 52)
