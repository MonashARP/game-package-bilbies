\title{Create a Shuffled Blackjack Shoe}
\usage{
create_shuffled_deck(noOfDecks = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{noOfDecks}{Integer (≥1). Number of decks to include in the shoe (default = 4). A typical Blackjack shoe contains 4 to 8 decks.}
}
\value{
A [vctrs][vctrs::new_rcrd] “card” record vector of length `52 * noOfDecks`. Each element is an S3 object of class `"card"` with these fields:
\itemize{
  \item \code{name}       – character, e.g. "2♣", "A♠"
  \item \code{rank}       – character, one of "Two", "Three", …, "Ace"
  \item \code{suit_symbol}– character, one of "♠", "♥", "♦", "♣"
  \item \code{suit}       – character, one of "Spade", "Heart", "Diamond", "Club"
  \item \code{is_face}    – logical; TRUE for Jack/Queen/King, FALSE otherwise
}
After update, the creating_shuffle_deck now able to return a vctrs record with the above fields instead of just a character vector.
}
\description{
Creates a shuffled Blackjack shoe consisting of multiple standard 52-card decks combined.
Each standard deck includes cards from all four suits (\code{"♠", "♥", "♦", "♣"}) and 13 ranks (\code{2–10, J, Q, K, A}).
The function has been updated to include vctrs class "card" record with fields: name, rank, suit_symbol, suit, and is_face.
name is basically the card's name, rank is the English word for the rank, suit_symbol is the Unicode symbol for the suit,
suit is the English word for the suit, and is_face indicates if the card is a face card (Jack, Queen, King).
}
\details{
Because we use vctrs::new_rcrd(...), the returned object is a vctrs record with class card. You can extract the underlying
character names with as.character(), or access fields via vctrs::field(). The print.card() method will display all card names,
and format.card() returns the card’s "name" field.”

\examples{
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
length(deck)                   # Should be 208 (4 decks of 52 as default setting)
deck                           # Prints the deck of cards
deck2 <- create_shuffled_deck(noOfDecks = 6)
length(deck2)                 # Should be 312 (6 * 52)
