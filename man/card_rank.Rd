\title{Extract Card Ranks}
\usage{
card_rank(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `card` object or a character vector of card ranks (e.g., "Two", "Jack").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods. Not used.}
}
\value{
Depending on the method:
\describe{
  \item{\code{card}}{A character vector containing the `rank` field of each card.}
  \item{\code{character}}{The input character vector, unchanged.}
}
}
\description{
`card_rank()` retrieves the \code{rank} field from a vctrs "card" record (class \code{"card"}).
When applied to a plain character vector, it returns the vector unchanged. This function was
specifically designed to work with vctrs "card" objects created by \code{create_shuffled_deck()}.
}
\details{
- For objects of class \code{"card"}, \code{card_rank.card(x)} extracts the \code{rank} field
  via \code{vctrs::field(x, "rank")}, returning a character vector of card ranks (e.g., "Ace").
- If \code{x} is a \code{character} vector, \code{card_rank.character(x)} simply returns \code{x} unchanged.
- For any other class, \code{card_rank.default(x)} throws an error.

\examples{
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
card_rank(deck)

card_rank(c("Queen", "Two", "Ace"))
