\title{Extract Card Suit Symbols}
\usage{
card_symbol(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either:

  \itemize{
    \item A vctrs “card” record (class \code{"card"}) as returned by \code{create_shuffled_deck()},
          or any other \code{"card"} object with a \code{suit_symbol} field; or
    \item A \code{character} vector of suit symbols (e.g.\ \samp{"♠", "♥", "♦", "♣"}).
  }
  If \code{x} is a \code{"card"} record, returns a character vector of the \code{suit_symbol} field;
  if \code{x} is a \code{character} vector, returns \code{x} unchanged.}
}
\value{
Depending on the method:
\describe{
  \item{\code{card}}{A \code{character} vector (same length as \code{x}), containing the \code{suit_symbol}
                   field of each card.}
  \item{\code{character}}{The input \code{character} vector, returned as it is.}
}
}
\description{
`card_symbol()` retrieves the \code{suit_symbol} field from a vctrs “card” record (class \code{"card"}).
When applied to a plain character vector, it returns the vector unchanged. This function was
specifically designed to work with vctrs “card” objects created by \code{create_shuffled_deck()}.
}
\details{
- For objects of class \code{"card"}, \code{card_symbol.card(x)} extracts the \code{suit_symbol} field
  via \code{vctrs::field(x, "suit_symbol")}, returning a character vector of card suit symbols
  (e.g.\ \samp{"♠", "♥", "♦"}).

- If \code{x} is a \code{character} vector, \code{card_symbol.character(x)} simply returns \code{x}
  unchanged.

- For any other class, \code{card_symbol.default(x)} throws an error indicating that only
  \code{"card"} or \code{character} inputs are accepted.
