\title{Extract Card Suit Symbols}
\usage{
card_symbol(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `card` object (created by `create_shuffled_deck()`) or a character vector of suit symbols (e.g., "♠", "♥").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods. Not used.}
}
\value{
Depending on the method:
\describe{
  \item{\code{card}}{A character vector containing the `suit_symbol` field of each card.}
  \item{\code{character}}{The input character vector, unchanged.}
}
}
\description{
`card_symbol()` retrieves the \code{suit_symbol} field from a vctrs "card" record (class \code{"card"}).
When applied to a plain character vector, it returns the vector unchanged. This function was
specifically designed to work with vctrs "card" objects created by \code{create_shuffled_deck()}.
}
\details{
- For objects of class \code{"card"}, \code{card_symbol.card(x)} extracts the \code{suit_symbol} field
  via \code{vctrs::field(x, "suit_symbol")}, returning a character vector of card suit symbols
  (e.g., "♠", "♥", "♦").
- If \code{x} is a \code{character} vector, \code{card_symbol.character(x)} simply returns \code{x} unchanged.
- For any other class, \code{card_symbol.default(x)} throws an error.

\examples{
deck <- create_shuffled_deck()
