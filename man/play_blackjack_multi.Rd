\title{Simulate Multiplayer Blackjack (2 players)}
\usage{
play_blackjack_multi(n_players = 2, input_fn = readline, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_players}{Number of players (default is 2)}

\item{input_fn}{holder to obtain player actions (defaults to \code{readline}) which can be overridden to inject fake input for unit tests or if the user want to add fake actions.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused; reserved for future extensions)}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per player and these columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{player}}{Character, e.g.\ “Player 1”, “Player 2”, ….}
  \item{\code{hand}}{Character: the player’s final cards, space-separated (e.g.\ “A♠ 10♦ 3♣”).}
  \item{\code{score}}{Integer: total value of the player’s hand.}
  \item{\code{result}}{Character: one of “Player busts,” “Dealer busts,” “Player wins,”
                       “Dealer wins,” or “Push.”}
}
}
\description{
Simulates a full round of Blackjack with \code{n_players} playing against a dealer.  Each player
can choose to hit or stand in turn; after all players have finished, the dealer draws according
to standard rules.  Finally, each player’s total is compared to the dealer’s to determine the outcome.

\details{
This function use its own build-in creating_shuffle_deck to create a shuffled deck of cards,
and then deals two cards to all the player and the dealer. The player can then choose to hit
(draw another card) or stand (end their turn). After the every player's turn, the dealer will draw cards
according to standard Blackjack rules until they reach a score of 17 or higher. The function then
evaluates the scores and determines the winner. Moreover, it is not possible for the user to use
their custom deck instead. The function only support deck of card from the vctrs class.

\examples{
# Simulate a game with 2 players using automatic decisions
# play_blackjack_multi() # Defaults to 2 players
# Player 1's turn
# Hit (h) or stand (s)?
# Player 2's turn
# Hit (h) or stand (s)?
# Example of using a custom input function to simulate player actions
play_blackjack_multi(n_players = 2, input_fn = function(...) "h") # Both player hit until burst
